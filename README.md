			GAtune

-------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this application is to help you build melodies using the principle of interactive genetic algorithms.

GAtune uses the CFugue MusicNote and  WPF MDI libraries. You need to build these on your machine and add the DLLs to GAtune's bin folder. I included the versions I used when developing the project.
NOTE: I customized some functions from the CFugue library to suit my needs (see GAtune.MusicNoteLib.MusicNoteLib.cs). You need to build my version (or download CFugue and modify the required functions accordingly) for GAtune to work properly.
